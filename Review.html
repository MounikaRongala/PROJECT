    <h2>What is Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>
        Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere, which can include gases, particulates, and biological molecules. These pollutants can be natural (like volcanic ash or pollen) or caused by human activities (such as emissions from vehicles, industrial processes, and burning fossil fuels). Air pollution can harm human health, damage ecosystems, and contribute to climate change by altering the natural composition of the atmosphere.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Types of Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>Air pollution comes in various forms, primarily categorized by the pollutants involved. Here are the main types:<br/>
        1.Particulate Matter (PM): Tiny particles like dust, dirt, soot, and smoke suspended in the air. These particles are often classified by size:<br/>
        Coarse particles that are less than 10 micrometers in diameter.<br/>
        Fine particles less than 2.5 micrometers, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.<br/>
        2.Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂): A harmful gas emitted by vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. It contributes to respiratory problems and the formation of ground-level ozone.<br/>
        3.Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂): Produced mainly by burning fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil) and in industrial processes. SO₂ can lead to acid rain, harming ecosystems and infrastructure.<br/>
        4.Carbon Monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless gas produced by burning fossil fuels, especially from motor vehicles. High levels of CO reduce oxygen delivery to organs and tissues.<br/>
        5.Ozone (O₃): Ground-level ozone is created by chemical reactions between NOx (nitrogen oxides) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in sunlight. It is a primary component of smog and harms respiratory health.<br/>
        6.Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Chemicals found in products like paints, solvents, and gasoline. They contribute to smog formation and can cause various health effects, especially indoors.<br/>
        7.Lead: A toxic metal found in air due to industrial processes and previously in gasoline. Exposure can affect the nervous system and development, especially in children.<br/>
        8.Ammonia (NH₃): Emitted mainly from agricultural activities and contributes to particulate formation when it reacts with other pollutants in the air.<br/>
        9.Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs): Toxic chemicals that persist in the environment and accumulate in living organisms, such as pesticides and industrial chemicals. They can cause health issues, including cancer and immune system damage.<br/>
        Each of these pollutants has distinct sources and impacts on health, climate, and ecosystems.
