    <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>Following are the important causes of air pollution:</p>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h2>
        <p>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Automobiles</h2>
        <p>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Agricultural Activities</h2>
        <p>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides, and fertilizers emit harmful chemicals into the atmosphere and contaminate it.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Factories and Industries</h2>
        <p>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons, and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Mining Activities</h2>
        <p>In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Domestic Sources</h2>
        <p>The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released into the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>The hazardous effects of air pollution on the environment include:</p>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Diseases</h2>
        <p>Air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans. The cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. Children living near polluted areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. Many people die every year due to the direct or indirect effects of air pollution.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Global Warming</h2>
        <p>Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of the air. This has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth, known as global warming. This has resulted in the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. Many areas are submerged underwater.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Acid Rain</h2>
        <p>The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides into the air. The water droplets combine with these pollutants, become acidic, and fall as acid rain, which damages human, animal, and plant life.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Ozone Layer Depletion</h2>
        <p>The release of chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of the ozone layer. The depleting ozone layer does not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye problems among individuals.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Effect on Animals</h2>
        <p>The air pollutants suspend in the water bodies and affect aquatic life. Pollution also compels the animals to leave their habitat and shift to a new place. This renders them stray and has also led to the extinction of a large number of animal species.</p>
